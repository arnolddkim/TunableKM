# TunableKM
Matlab codes that compute images formed using KM and modified KM methods for SAR measurements.

These codes have been used to generate the results presented in the manuscript entitled, "Tunable high-resolution synthetic aperture radar imaging" by A. D. Kim and C. Tsogka. The abstract for this manuscript appears below.

## Abstract

We have recently introduced a modification of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) method for synthetic aperture radar. This method incorporates a user-defined parameter, Ïµ, that allows for tunable quantitative high-resolution imaging. However, this method requires relatively large single-to-noise ratios (SNR) to work effectively. Here, we first identify the fundamental mechanism in that method that produces high-resolution images. Then we introduce a modification to Kirchhoff Migration (KM) that uses the same mechanism to produce tunable, high-resolution images. This modified KM method can be applied to low SNR measurements. We show simulation results that demonstrate the features of this method.
